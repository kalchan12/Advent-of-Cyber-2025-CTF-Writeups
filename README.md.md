# Advent of Cyber Writeups

This repository contains my writeups for the **Advent of Cyber challenges**.  
Each folder or file represents a specific day, documenting the commands, explanations, and final answers I used to solve the 24-day challenge.

## Contents

- Daily writeups for all 24 challenges
    
- Notes, commands, and walkthroughs
    
- Explanations of key concepts (Linux, web security, logs, malware, privilege escalation, etc.)
    

## Purpose

This repo serves as:

- A personal archive of all my work
    
- A reference for studying Linux, cybersecurity, and CTF workflows
    
- A way to track my progress throughout the event
    

## Structure

`Day-1/ Day-2/ Day-3/ ... Day-24/ README.md`

## Notes

These writeups are intended for learning and documentation, not for spoiling solutions during the live event.
